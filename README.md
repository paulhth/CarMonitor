# Car Monitor by Paul Horvath

License project developed by Paul Horvath Serban (AC CTI RO) - Polytechnic University of Timisoara.

The proposed project is a system that effectively scans the cars' real-time parameters (such as instant velocity, engine revelations per minute, engine consumption, oil level, coolant level etc), retrieves the data through an OBD-II reader which communicates via Bluetooth to the ESP-32 board. The ESP-32 board then deploys the data to a web server hosted by itself, where a user with internet access can view the data and analyze it accordingly. This project is suitable for multiple fleets owned by ride-sharing companies, which need an app to monitor their own cars and reduce maintenance cost.

The project is developed on ESP-32 microcontroller on a NodeMCU-32S development board. This specific development board has the Wifi and Bluetooth implemented by default, modules which are used at their full capabilities in this project.


 # [RO] Rularea proiectului

1. Se conecteaza cititorul OBD-II (Vgate iCar Pro V2) la masina.
> Este necesar ca masina sa aiba minim contactul pus dar se recomanda sa se porneasca motorul masinii.

2. Se conecteaza ESP-32 la o sursa de alimentare. 
> Este recomandat sa se conecteze prin USB la Laptopul dotat cu extensia PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code, sau orice aplicatie care are integrat un Serial Monitor pentru a urmari statusul lui ESP-32.
> 
- :warning: In cazul in care placa nu are codul incarcat in memoria sa, este necesara urcarea prin apasarea butonului PlatformIO: Upload. Acesta este un script care compileaza sistemul, iar daca nu sunt erori, va sterge memoria placii si o va incarca cu noul cod dorit. Dupa terminarea incarcarii, codul se va rula automat si terminalul de monitorizare se va deschide. 

3. ESP-32 se va conecta automat atat la reteaua setata, cat si la cititorul OBD-II. Acesta va incepe sa initializez canalul de comunicare cu cititorul, apoi va interoga parametrii setati. Acesti parametri vor fi afisati pe serverul web in timp real.

 # [EN] Running the project
1.  Connect the OBD-II reader (Vgate iCar Pro V2) to the car.

> The car must have at least the ignition on, but it is recommended to start the engine.

2.  Connect the ESP-32 to a power source.

> It is recommended to connect it via USB to a laptop equipped with the PlatformIO extension in Visual Studio Code, or any application that has an integrated Serial Monitor to monitor the status of the ESP-32.

-   :warning: If the board does not have the code loaded into its memory, it is necessary to upload it by pressing the PlatformIO: Upload button. This is a script that compiles the system, and if there are no errors, it will erase the board's memory and load it with the new desired code. After the upload is complete, the code will run automatically, and the monitoring terminal will open.

3.  The ESP-32 will automatically connect to both the set network and the OBD-II reader. It will start to initialize the communication channel with the reader and then query the set parameters. These parameters will be displayed on the web server in real-time.


# Organizing the project

The project is organized in two phases: ![Phase 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-1-blue) and ![Phase 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-2-green).

![Phase 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-1-blue) is represented by the board's capability to successfully deploy and sustain a web server, where the real-time data will be prompted and displayed to the final user.

![Phase 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-2-green) is represented by the board's capability to successfully pair itself with the OBD-II device through the Bluetooth module and successfully read and temporarily store the real-time data.

# Understanding the version control system

The project is organized into branches, where the branch **main** is the official release. The branches which derive from main and where the work is effectively done, have a nomenclature that must be obeyed at all times. A typical branch has the following template:

**Px-Bx** where **Px** refers to the phase (which can be either one or two) and **Bx** refers to the branch itself. Example:

**P1-B3** - Phase 1, Branch 3.

> **Note:** The branch management system may be updated at any time, expect the README.md file to be updated when this happens.

# Dependencies

There are several dependencies which are necessary for the project to work:

**ESP Async WebServer**          - Used to locally host and maintain the frontend webserver.
**powerbroker2/ELMDuino@^3.2.5** - Top-level library used to send/receive commands and information through the OBDII adapter.

> **Note:** At the moment, the ESP-32 board has the following memory layout:
> RAM:   [==       ] 17.5% (used 57428 bytes from 327680 bytes)\
> Flash: [======== ] 78.5% (used 1543173 bytes from 1966080 bytes)

# Known problems and their fixes

- When connecting to a hotspot: The network must be on 2.4GHz, the ESP-32 board cannot connect to 5GHz networks

# Upcoming code and documentation aspects

- When documenting, don't forget to add Sequence Diagrams in PlantUML. [Add the extension to VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml)
- For code: -> Check if the parameters show up fine inside the local network
            -> Possibility of remote host using AWS
